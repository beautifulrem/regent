Hackathon entry: **MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit × 1Shot API × Venice AI "Dev Cook-Off"** (submit by 2026-06-15).

## ✨ Highlights

- 🛡️ **A standing, vote-only, revocable AI mandate** — one ERC-7710 delegation lets an agent vote *any* proposal on the DAO board, **provably cannot touch your funds** (the in-app Tamper Probe shows the forbidden call reverting at the enforcer).
- ✂️ **A one-click kill switch** — `disableDelegation(root)` cascade-revokes the *whole* agent chain; the next redemption reverts on-chain. Self-custody you can watch.
- 🤝 **Real A2A attenuation** — user → orchestrator → analyst, each hop provably *narrower* (vote cap, expiry, `limitedCalls`), enforced at redemption.
- 🔒 **Venice TEE committee** — four lenses + an arbiter decide every vote inside a sealed Intel TDX enclave: attested, signed, and even **spoken aloud** (`/audio/speech`).
- 💸 **x402 pay-per-query** — the agent pays the data source a 0.001 USDC toll from a scoped `Erc20TransferAmount` budget, settled on-chain.
- 🚀 **Zero-ETH mainnet voting via 1Shot** — the 3-hop chain is redeemed in ONE relay call: `castVote` executes **as the user's smart account**, the user's **EIP-7702 upgrade rides the same call**, a sponsor pays the USDC fee, the relayer fronts the ETH gas.
- 🧾 **Everything receipted** — every claim above links to a real transaction in [`EVIDENCE.md`](./EVIDENCE.md).

## 🧭 How it works

1. **Grant a standing mandate** — your MetaMask smart account signs **one** ERC-7710 delegation: an
   AI may `castVote` on **any** proposal on this DAO board, **vote-only** (never your funds), bounded
   by a **vote cap + validity window** you choose, revocable anytime. (Caveats: `AllowedTargets` +
   `AllowedMethods`, plus `LimitedCalls` / `Timestamp`.)
2. **Re-delegate (the mechanism)** — an **Orchestrator** smart account attenuated-redelegates that
   right to an **Analyst**. This 2-hop ERC-7710 chain is what makes the mandate *attenuable* and
   *cascade-revocable*; it is the plumbing, not the pitch.
3. **Decide** — the Analyst privately analyses **each** proposal inside a **Venice TEE** (Intel TDX)
   and decides For / Against / Abstain — the cast `support` provably comes from the model, not hardcoded.
4. **Vote** — the Analyst redeems the chain leaf→root; the DelegationManager executes `castVote`
   **as your smart account**. Under the one grant the agent votes proposal after proposal, up to your cap.
5. **Recall (the wow)** — you hit **Recall** → one `disableDelegation` on the root cascade-revokes the
   whole chain; the next redemption reverts on-chain. *Self-custody you can watch.*

> The repo also ships a CLI path (`pnpm vote:2hop`) that runs the **same** mechanism against a real
> OpenZeppelin `Governor`, with the scope tightened further to a single **locked `proposalId`** — an
> even narrower variant of the same delegation, kept for the on-chain Governor receipts in `EVIDENCE.md`.

### 🪙 Zero-gas membership — what the mainnet run proves for a real DAO

The recorded Base-mainnet cast ([`0xc486…5092`](https://basescan.org/tx/0xc48632ca8bc72db8c68eabd3e7dde90c5eae37b6afef60e70b1e686a8f8b5092))
splits the vote into **two delegations inside one atomic relay transaction** — and that split is a
product shape, not a demo trick:

- **Members sign authority, nothing else.** The voter's key holds **0 ETH and 0 USDC**; even its
  EIP-7702 upgrade rides the same relay call. The on-chain voter of record is the member's own
  smart account.
- **The DAO runs the fee sponsor.** A treasury-funded account signs a *USDC-transfer-only*
  delegation (cappable per-tx / cumulative budget / expiry). It can reimburse relay fees and do
  nothing else — and it gains zero voting power.
- **1Shot glues the two atomically** and fronts the real ETH gas: either the vote lands *and* the
  fee is paid, or neither happens.

So a DAO can stand up a "voting-gas account" once, and members never think about gas again. The
sponsor subsidises *participation*, not *direction* — it signs before any decision exists and
cannot condition payment on how the vote goes. (In this repo the sponsor role is played by the
disposable burner; in production it would be the DAO's ops treasury.)

## 🧱 Why ERC-7710 — nothing weaker gives all four at once

Letting an AI vote *your* governance demands **four properties at the same time**, and only a
scoped, revocable ERC-7710 delegation delivers all four. Every weaker option fails at least one:

| Approach | Vote-only (can't touch funds) | Bounded (≤N votes, expires) | Revocable on-chain in one click | Custody kept (key never exposed) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Hand the agent a private key / seed | ❌ can do anything | ❌ | ❌ must rotate the key | ❌ |
| Broad session key / full-account delegation | ❌ can move funds | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| `delegate()` voting power (ERC20Votes) | ⚠️ delegates *weight to an address*, not a *bounded agent mandate* | ❌ | ❌ re-delegate ≠ revoke-an-agent | ✅ |
| Co-sign every vote | ✅ | n/a | n/a | ✅ but ❌ not autonomous |
| Custodial "AI voting" service | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ trust the operator | ❌ |
| **Mandate — ERC-7710 scoped + revocable** | ✅ `AllowedMethods`=castVote · `AllowedTargets`=this board | ✅ `LimitedCalls` + `Timestamp` caveats | ✅ `disableDelegation` cascade-revokes the chain | ✅ the EVM enforces — the agent can't override |

A voting agent is the *ideal* 7710 use case: you want it to act **repeatedly and autonomously** (a
standing mandate), yet provably **only vote — never spend**, and you want to **pull the plug the
instant it misbehaves**. That exact shape — recurring · scoped-to-one-method · zero-funds · instant
on-chain revoke — is what ERC-7710 caveats plus `disableDelegation` give, and a bare key, a session
key, or token-weight `delegate()` do not. Note the contrast: DAOs already let you delegate voting
*power* to an address you trust to vote however *it* likes; Mandate instead delegates a **scoped,
bounded, revocable mandate to an agent that decides per-proposal in a TEE** — and you can yank it
without ever moving your tokens. The **Tamper Probe** proves the negative live: ask the delegated
agent to move funds and the redemption **reverts at the enforcer**, on-chain.

### …and why it must be a *chain* (re-delegation, not N flat grants)

The orchestrator→analyst hop is not decoration — remove `parentDelegation` and the product breaks:

- **One signature, rotating workforce.** You sign once, to the orchestrator. It can spin up, retire
  or replace analyst agents (fresh keys, fresh TEE sessions) by re-delegating — narrower each time —
  without ever sending you back to MetaMask. Flat grants would mean a popup per analyst, forever.
- **Attenuation is enforced, not promised.** A child delegation can only **narrow** its parent. The
  analyst's scope (this board, `castVote` only, fewer votes, shorter window) is validated against
  the parent's authority on-chain at redemption — the orchestrator *cannot* hand out more than it holds.
- **The kill switch only exists because it's a chain.** Every leaf hangs off the root by parent-hash,
  so one `disableDelegation(root)` revokes every downstream agent at once — that's Recall. With N
  flat grants you'd be hunting down N separate revocations while a rogue agent keeps voting.

## 🔭 Testnet vs mainnet — two networks, two jobs

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/assets/demo-testnet.gif" width="880" alt="A live Base-Sepolia vote under the standing mandate: one click, no new signature — re-delegation, Venice TEE committee, x402 toll, on-chain cast">

<sub>A <b>live Base-Sepolia</b> vote under a standing mandate, recorded as it ran: one click, <b>no new
signature</b> — attenuated re-delegation → the Venice TEE committee deliberates → the x402 toll settles
(receipt stamps on the Arbiter) → the vote lands on the VoteBoard.</sub>

</div>

The app ships both networks deliberately — they answer different questions:

| | **Base Sepolia** (default) | **Base mainnet** |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | The **live, interactive demo** — connect MetaMask, grant, watch each vote run, Recall anytime | An **honest replay** of a real recorded run, plus a live `eth_getCode` 7702 check; execution stays CLI opt-in (`pnpm 1shot:full --mainnet`) |
| Delegation chain | 2-hop: you → orchestrator → analyst (standing: any proposal · ≤N votes · expiry) | 3-hop: user → orchestrator → analyst → **1Shot target**, the leaf locked to exactly `castVote(proposal, decidedSupport)` |
| Who casts · who pays gas | the analyst redeems the chain and pays **testnet ETH** (free faucet) | the **1Shot relayer** redeems — **nobody holds ETH**: the burner sponsors the fee in USDC, 1Shot fronts the real gas |
| x402 toll | 1 **mUSDC** (our 6-dec mock) per query, pulled from the budget **you** signed at grant | 0.001 **real USDC**, paid by the deployed agent wallet (the burner) |
| EIP-7702 | not used — Hybrid (ERC-4337) smart accounts, so no 7702 chip | the voter EOA upgrades **in-place inside the cast relay call**; the 7702 chip lights at that beat |
| Recall | ✅ one click, live (keyless UserOp) | recorded evidence; reproduce live on Sepolia |
| Why it exists | judges can **drive every mechanic, free, in minutes** | proof the same mechanism survives **real-money conditions** |

Same product, same code path up to the cast: the testnet proves you can *touch* it; the mainnet proves
it's *real*. (Tip: open `localhost:3000/?run=<runId>` to watch any orchestrator run live in the cockpit —
the CLI verify scripts print the id.)

## 🏆 Hackathon tracks

**The pitch in one line:** a *standing, vote-only, revocable* AI governance mandate — an agent votes
any proposal on the DAO for you, **provably cannot touch your funds**, and you can **kill the whole
delegation chain on-chain in one click**. The A2A re-delegation, Venice TEE, x402 and 1Shot below are
the mechanism that makes that real (the novelty is the governance use case + the kill switch, not
hop-count).

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r build && pnpm -r test          # 201 tests, all green: 108 shared · 58 app · 20 Foundry · 15 agents

# one-time: generate throwaway demo keys into .env + print a funding checklist
pnpm bootstrap:accounts                 # then fund the printed addresses from a Base Sepolia faucet

# reproduce the core mechanics live (Base Sepolia, testnet gas only):
pnpm vote:2hop                          # real 2-hop attenuated delegation → castVote on the Governor
pnpm revoke:2hop                        # kill-the-chain: disable root → the same fresh chain reverts
pnpm orchestrate                        # autonomous: grant → Venice TEE decision → real vote
pnpm proposal --reseed --wait           # refresh the (300s) active proposal window

# the full UI demo:
pnpm --filter @mandate/orchestrator serve     # HTTP run API on :8787
pnpm --filter @mandate/app dev                # Next.js app on :3000 (connect MetaMask → Grant → Recall)
```

## 🗺️ Architecture

See **[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**. In short — a pnpm monorepo:

```
packages/shared/      delegation (ERC-7710) · Governor/proposal helpers · Venice client · 1Shot client · run contract (zod)
packages/contracts/   Foundry: VotesToken (ERC20Votes, timestamp clock) + MandateGovernor + deploy/propose scripts
agent/orchestrator/   HTTP service: holds the root, attenuated-redelegates, drives the run state machine
                      (SSE run stream · 1Shot webhook receiver · Venice TTS proxy)
agent/analyst/        decides support in the Venice TEE and casts by redeeming the chain
agent/mandate-mcp/    MCP server: any agent can DESCRIBE/REQUEST a mandate — but the request comes
                      back UNSIGNED; only the human's MetaMask smart account can grant. No self-granting.
app/                  Next.js 15 — connect, grant (browser signing), live authority graph, Recall
```

## 🔌 Smart Accounts Kit surface — what Mandate actually calls

Every delegation primitive is the real SDK, verified against `@metamask/smart-accounts-kit@1.6.0`
(see [`packages/shared/src/delegation.ts`](./packages/shared/src/delegation.ts),
[`app/src/lib/wallet.ts`](./app/src/lib/wallet.ts), [`app/src/lib/recall.ts`](./app/src/lib/recall.ts)):

| API | Where | Role in the mandate |
|---|---|---|
| `toMetaMaskSmartAccount(Implementation.Hybrid)` | `wallet.ts`, agents | the user / orchestrator / analyst ERC-4337 smart accounts (EIP-7702 Hybrid) |
| `getSmartAccountsEnvironment(chainId)` | `delegation.ts` | resolves `DelegationManager` + enforcer addresses per chain |
| `createDelegation({ scope, to, from, environment, salt })` | `delegation.ts` | the **root** grant |
| `createDelegation({ …, parentDelegation })` | `delegation.ts` | the **attenuated re-delegation** (orchestrator → analyst), parent-linked |
| `ScopeType.FunctionCall` (`targets`, `selectors`) | `delegation.ts` | binds the grant to `castVote` on this board only → `AllowedTargets` + `AllowedMethods` enforcers (this is what blocks "move funds") |
| `createCaveatBuilder(env).addCaveat('timestamp' \| 'limitedCalls')` | `delegation.ts` | the standing bounds → `Timestamp` (expiry) + `LimitedCalls` (≤ maxVotes) enforcers |
| `account.signDelegation({ delegation })` | `wallet.ts`, orchestrator | EIP-712 signature over each delegation (root + re-delegation) |
| `createExecution({ target, callData })` + `ExecutionMode.SingleDefault` | `delegation.ts` | the `castVote` action the chain authorizes |
| `contracts.DelegationManager.encode.redeemDelegations(...)` | `delegation.ts` | the analyst redeems the chain **leaf→root** → executes `castVote` *as the user's smart account* |
| `contracts.DelegationManager.encode.disableDelegation(...)` | `delegation.ts` | **the kill switch** — disabling the root cascade-revokes the whole chain |
| `createBundlerClient().sendUserOperation(...)` (viem AA, Pimlico) | `recall.ts` | the recall is a keyless UserOp from the user smart account |

Enforcers exercised: `AllowedTargetsEnforcer` · `AllowedMethodsEnforcer` · `TimestampEnforcer` ·
`LimitedCallsEnforcer` (plus `AllowedCalldataEnforcer` in the single-proposal CLI path, which locks
`proposalId`). The decoded scope is rendered live in the app's **Permission X-Ray**.

## ⚖️ Honest limitations

Documented choices, not hidden stubs:

- **Demo-scoped governance.** The app's standing mandate runs on our self-built `VoteBoard`; the
  OpenZeppelin `Governor` path is the CLI reproduction (`pnpm vote:2hop`) — same SAK primitives, scope
  tightened to one locked `proposalId`. `votingPeriod` is **300 s** so a judge can reproduce a full
  grant → vote → recall cycle in minutes, not days.
- **mUSDC is a mock.** The x402 toll settles in our 6-decimal `MockUSDC` on Base Sepolia. The only
  real-USDC money leg is the 1Shot mainnet relay fee (0.01 USDC).
- **Self-built x402 seller.** The seller verifies and redeems the scoped ERC-7710 delegation itself;
  it does not settle through Coinbase's x402 facilitator.
- **Venice inference is prepaid.** x402 pays the proposal-data toll; the Venice TEE call itself is
  billed to a prepaid API key.
- **The app's mainnet panel is an honest replay.** It replays pinned, real Base-mainnet artifacts
  (the full-chain castVote + x402 toll txs, linked to Basescan) with a genuinely **live**
  `eth_getCode` 7702 check; live mainnet execution stays opt-in via CLI
  (`pnpm 1shot:full --mainnet`, free dry-quote via `--estimate`).
- The mainnet Governor and every proposal carry `HACKATHON DEMO — NO REAL VALUE` and a 0 treasury.

## 🔐 Safety / boundaries

Throwaway keys only; secrets stay in `.env` (gitignored). Testnet first. Any mainnet action (the
1Shot leg, ~$5 USDC) is opt-in and quoted live before signing. The mainnet Governor + every proposal
carry a `HACKATHON DEMO — NO REAL VALUE` disclaimer.
